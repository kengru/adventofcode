# Advent of code!

Attempts at solving all of [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) for the month of december using typescript. I will try to create a README.md file with the prompt for every day.

If you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en) you can run any file like this:

```bash
npx ts-node 2023/01-trebuchet/part1.ts
```

When debugging, use:

```bash
npx nodemon 2023/01-trebuchet/part2.ts
```
