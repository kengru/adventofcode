# Advent of code 2023!

Attempts at solving all of [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) for the month of december using typescript. I will try to create a readme with the prompt for every day.

If you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en) you can run any file like this:

```bash
npx ts-node src/01-trebuchet/part1.ts
```
